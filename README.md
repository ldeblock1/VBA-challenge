# VBA-challenge
In this challenge I utilized VBA to loop through three worsheets that each have stock price and volume data organized by year on each excel page.
Over each loop the program Loops through the tickers and adds up each volume entry and displays the total yearly volume for that stock. The loop also
captures the opening price and closing price for each ticker. The program then calculates the total volume, yearly change, and yearly percentage change for each 
stock ticker and outputs it in a table next to the data. The program color codes each total price change calculattion as green or red depending on it being 
positive or negative. Next, the program then loops through each calculation to output the highest percent increase, highest percent decrease, and 
highest total volume and their corresponding stock tickers.
